Input Data
-------------
* The input data (accounts data) that is loaded in memory by API resides in [accounts](https://github.com/mbelsare/money-transfer/tree/master/accounts) directory of repo's parent path. 
* Currently the API loads only 6 records in memory from `accounts_detail.json` for processing.
* The account details that are loaded in memory for testing with their accountStatus and balance are
```
  | customerId | accountId | accountBalance  | accountStatus |
__________________________________________________________________
  | customer1  | 12345     | 19450           | Active        |
  | customer1  | 45321     | 3500            | Active        |
  | customer2  | 77777     | 12000           | Active        |
  | customer3  | 89990     | 16300           | Active        |
  | customer4  | 67890     | 0               | Closed        |
  | customer5  | 11345     | 1520            | Hold          |

Architecture
-------------
###### Assumptions
  - The service is called by multiple services.
  - The API needs to transfer money from one account to another account which is an update to the state of `account_details` table. It is a **POST** request.
   
###### Design approach
  - The API should update the withdrawal account balance and deposit account balance with the the amount provided by client in request body.
  - Since withdrawal & deposit, both operations update the state of DB, the resulting API call is a `POST` request since the client can transfer funds multiple times to the same account.
  - The `POST` operation handles both `withdrawal` and `deposit` in one execution flow(unified way) without having to make 2 separate API calls internally.
  - The service should run for multiple concurrent requests by maintaining the state of each transaction in its own scope
  - Used `Akka` and `Akka HTTP` actor based implementation to solve for concurrency, scalability, distributed & async execution for building high performant applications through use of `message queues` for communication.
  - Applications built on top of `Akka` are multi-actor-based system that allows for configurable scaling of use case loads by routing requests to actors based on their queue sizes.
  - The actors in the `money-transfer` App are configured in the form of `DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)` through a json file in `conf/` directory
  - The definition & configs for each actor is provided in `conf/money_transfer.conf` file.
  - The app should never call **deposit** functionality/actor in case **withdraw** operation fails. This feature is implemented through a `Skippability` trait that each plugin executes.

The API endpoint is `/accounts/transfers/:accountId/money-transfer`  

**Body**
  ```
  {
    "depositAccountId": String,
    "transferAmount": Double
  }
  ```
  **accountId** : *Withdrawal account id in URI [String]*<br/>
  **depositAccountId** : *Recipient account id [String]*<br/>
  **transferAmount** : *Amount to transfer [Double]*
  
  **Returns**
  ```
  {
    "accountId": String,
    "depositAccountId": String,
    "withdrawalAccountBalance": Double,
    "depositAccountBalance": Double,
    "status": Boolean,
    "transactionIdentifier": UUID
  }
  ```

System Overview
---------------
![SystemOverview](images/SystemOverview.png)

##### Project directory structure & Technical overview
* `accounts` directory contains a JSON file with list of all the accounts to be loaded in memory.
* `conf` directory has 2 files
    1. `route.json`  which defines the API route (endpoint) to be created along with health check and also the DAG which executes actors (Business Logic) as part of the request execution
    2. `money_transfer.conf` defines the config for each actor
* The `money_transfer` API currently runs 3 actors part that form the DAG
    1. `withdraw` actor to withdraw amount from account to transfer to recipient.
    2. `deposit` actor to deposit amount into recipient account.
    3. `db` actor (which just logs currently) to store the current transaction to DB. This is a `log only` actor & establishes no connection to DB. But typically in a web service, you would log each transaction to DB. 
* `commons` module has common functionality code to support core and business logic execution. Some of commons classes are `ExceptionUtils`, `ValidationUtils`
* `plugins` module has all the business logic implemented which runs as part of each request. `AccountsOperation` class/actor has all the core business functionality required to withdraw or deposit funds to an account.
* `core` module is the orchestration layer for the Revolut `money-transfer` app. 
* The `core` module runs a set of actors that invoke the plugins through `reflection` implemented in `Executor` and `ScalaExecution` classes.<hr />
* The data model for the accounts table is provided in `data_model` directory of repo's parent path.
###### Execution flow
- The `RevolutApp` in `core` module is the entrypoint that runs the orchestration to build the API route and initialize business actors.
- Each object in `plugins` implements 2 methods -
    1. `startup` that initializes the actor in `DORMANT` state.
    2. `execute` that runs the actors when invoked through Ã¥ request. On complete execution, each actor's `STATE` is marked as `FINISHED_SUCCESSFULLY` or `FINISHED_UNSUCCESSFULLY` and the `ROUTE` is marked as `COMPLETE`.
- When a request (GET or POST) is made, the request is handled by `RouteGenerator` actor that uses `Akka directive` to build a route, obtain the `DAG` associated with the route & invoke the plugins defined in the DAG to execute the DAG/business logic.
- Each request is assigned a unique id `UUID` by `RouteGenerator` during its entire execution that is added to the `argsMap` to use by `Plugins`.
- The co-ordination between business actor/plugin execution is handled by `Orchestrator`, `Executor`, `TaskMonitor` and `TransactionMonitor` actors.
- The `Scheduler` actor just initializes (warms up) all the orchestration actors & calls the `startup` method on plugins.
- Each plugin implements the `Skippability` trait to Skip for execution of a functionality if a certain event occurs. For example, if `withdraw` operation fails, `deposit` actor should never be executed. Adding `Skippability` to actor config in `route.json` demonstrates that behavior. If `withdrawFlag` is *false*, the `deposit` operation is automatically skipped and the *skip operation* is logged to console/logs. 
- Caches have been implemented for all the actors to prevent reloading of configs, maintain actor states and avoid concurrency issues between multiple requests.
- Caches implement Map that store `transactionId` of each request as their key & object details as value. This ensures each request is uniquely identified and cached by a `UUID` to avoid concurrency issues between calls.
- Unit tests exist for all the classes, actors, caches and plugins.
- To demonstrate the correct behavior of API, run the `RouteGeneratorTests` which executes a DAG flow for different scenario of requests. The `RouteGeneratorTests` run a series of test API calls to validate multiple failure and success scenarios for the API. <hr />
* In order to call the `/money-transfer` API, run the app (as given in the steps above).
* Validate the API is up and running by calling the `/health-check`.
* cURL the endpoint using POSTMAN App or using cURL command.
* The logs for each request are populated in the terminal when the app boots up.
* Sample execution scenarios are provided in the section below.
